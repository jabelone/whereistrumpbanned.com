            stormed the United States Capitol after incitement by Donald Trump
            at an earlier rally. The riots disrupted the special joint session
            of Congress to count the Electoral College votes which are required
            to certify the results of the 2020 federal election.

            Donald Trump's continued lies about electoral and voter fraud, and
            attempts at preventing the peaceful transition of power have been
            frowned upon by leaders all around the world. However, after the
            unprecedented riots and storming of the US Capitol,
            <a href="https://twitter.com/i/events/1346985779981996032"
              >almost every major world leader</a
            >
            has condemned Trump's unethical and potentially illegal actions.
            This includes leaders of Canada, New Zealand, the UK, France, India,
            Australia, Scotland and many others.
          </p>
          <p>
            Due to these unprecedented events that have proven President Donald
            Trump is no longer capable of discharging his powers and duties of
            his office, there have been
